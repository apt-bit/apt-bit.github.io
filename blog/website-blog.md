### Starting a blog - 08/08/23
I thought it would be a good idea to record my progress in words, which I haven't been doing. I have just finished the "Building Interactive Websites" section of the full stack course. I am able to alter HTML elements with Javascript but I'm still rusty with it. I need to practice parts of the course outside of it on my own website and I think naughts and crosses would be a good webpage to make in this vein. It would develop my CSS and Javascript because the symbols will need to appear in the correct places and disappear for a new game.

I will try to record my thoughts at least once a week. I am progressing through this course as fast as I can at the moment as I will also be starting Open University soon and I need to finish it by then. I also do want to be looking for web dev jobs as soon as possible and for that I would like to get my website properly running which means getting to the back-end development part of the course.

I had the idea of making a chess board where you could move the pieces and just two people could play on the same screen. I would need to build up to this and naughts and crosses feels like a good place to start. Currently I am just making the webpages locally and eventually I will join them all together in the website when I am able to do that.
