# Website Blog

### Multiple pages - 11/08/23

Turns out its actually very simple to join webpages together on Github Pages, just link them. So I've added the naughts and crosses to the site and put a link in the header. There are some design inconsistences though so I probably need to have one CSS sheet which every page links to and then also separate ones for each page. Will sort that soon. Also would like to get this blog on there and be able to update it from the page that would be cool. I would be able to implement that at the moment but it would have to all be kept in the front end. I may do it that way first and then eventually change it to work with a proper database in the back end.

In the online course I have started to learn about asynchronous Javascript which seems quite complicated. I may have to slow down a bit for this section which is a bit frustrating but it is also quite an interesting new thing for me so that's cool.

I'm also updating my CV and using markdown for that which I quite like. Will be applying for new jobs soon.

Anyway thats all for now.

### Starting a blog - 08/08/23

I thought it would be a good idea to record my progress in words, which I haven't been doing. I have just finished the "Building Interactive Websites" section of the full stack course. I am able to alter HTML elements with Javascript but I'm still rusty with it. I need to practice parts of the course outside of it on my own website and I think naughts and crosses would be a good webpage to make in this vein. It would develop my CSS and Javascript because the symbols will need to appear in the correct places and disappear for a new game.

I will try to record my thoughts at least once a week. I am progressing through this course as fast as I can at the moment as I will also be starting Open University soon and I need to finish it by then. I also do want to be looking for web dev jobs as soon as possible and for that I would like to get my website properly running which means getting to the back-end development part of the course.

I had the idea of making a chess board where you could move the pieces and just two people could play on the same screen. I would need to build up to this and naughts and crosses feels like a good place to start. Currently I am just making the webpages locally and eventually I will join them all together in the website when I am able to do that.
