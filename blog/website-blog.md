### Software Engineering - 29/09/23

One of my courses (called Software Engineering) contains a lot of learning about different development methods, I think including these in my project development could be helpful. Test driven development could be quite motivating for me and having a clearer path and process would help a lot I think. Also it gives a better idea about how an actual company would be run. 

I'm also considering applying for more data driven jobs as I think I would be able to get interviews more easily seeing as I have a professional history more in that area.

Just staying on top of everything at the moment is not easy. No project progress this week at all.

### Busy Busy Busy - 22/09/23

I've had a lot on recently. Finally finished the front-end part of the course, the Redux part dragged so much as it's hard to get motivation to learn something I don't think I will be using at least in the short term. I also don't think it was taught particularly well in the course so that didn't help. There was also an extra part on Git and GitHub which I think was really useful to do with branches and debasing. Although I haven't ever done a pull request as I haven't used GitHub in a collaborative way it definitely helped me cement my Git knowledge a bit better.

Currently I'm torn between moving on to the back-end stuff which I think I'll be really quite interested in and starting a big React project which is also an exciting idea. Reading my previous post does make me lean towards the project side of things, especially since I would like to get into a new job soonish, current job is getting very tiring right now. However the subject of the project is quite a difficult thing to nail down since I know I will be spending a lot of time on it. I liked the idea of a Peep Show (the TV show) style card game with different characters on it with stats. However I assume a more professional and real-life scenario website would be more impressive to prospective employers maybe, or maybe something different would help me stand out I'm really uncertain about it.

I need to have a think about the options for this as it will be a large time commitment, I also really like the idea of test driven development and think I would really enjoy this approach of seeing the tests slowly turn green.

I have a lot to think about and I need a proper plan.

### Front-end Progression - 13/09/23

I'm closing in on completing the front-end portion of the Codecademy course. I will definitely finish it before I start my OU degree in October, luckily one module I will be doing concentrates on web development and cloud computing so I should still be making progress in this area even if I don't have time to look at the Codecademy course anymore.

I have finished the React part finally, it was very slow as I was trying to understand each part completely and now I am okay with React. I still need to concentrate on some project site, I am considering a store website for purchasing goods as I think that would demonstrate lots of relevant skills that employers may look for. 

Currently looking at Redux which I will probably not use in my own project; it seems to be a useful approach for debugging and good for larger projects but for my stuff it is probably an unnecessary constraint. However it is still useful to get a base level of knowledge.

Other than that I haven't started applying for jobs yet as I don't have a proper project completed yet so that should be my priority especially if I can link that in with my OU course to feed two birds with one scone.

Progression does feel very slow sometimes but I have gone back through some of the older posts in this blog to make myself feel a bit better. I've had a couple of more relaxed weeks which I really needed but I am definitely ready to get back into it right now.

### Slow Week - 31/08/23

Been busy with other stuff recently. Also progress has slowed since React is more complicated than other areas, it's also very difficult to debug in the Codecademy teaching browser which doesn't help. Been struggling with motivation recently. I think I want to concentrate on a project I make myself to help focus me. It's a little to early to do one using React I think so maybe just a normal website but I want to incorporate Javascript as much as possible.

I should take a look at other peoples portfolio websites and take inspiration from that. Or another option is to try to make a functional website like a shop or random quote generator. Also need to work on interview stuff. I need to get a job in this area at this point and I don't think I can wait until I know the full stack.

Don't have to get the first one I just need to be applying.

### React Confusion - 24/08/23

Okay, React can melt your brain.

I started learning about the state hook and it has probably taken me a few hours spread over several days to start to properly understand it. On the plus side its definitely cementing my knowledge of Javascript, I did not realise that iterative method callback functions accept three parameters but that is very useful to know.

I made a React website using create react app, (I call app Britain). It's useful to be able to test out my own code and also means I can still code on my laptop without internet on trains and stuff. It also forces me to learn more about GitHub and Git because I have to use the online repository to make sure I'm working on up-to-date code, these are both very useful to be honest and I've started using them for other areas such as my CV (although I keep that private on GitHub). I implemented a "shop" into my React website, basically just a list of buttons that represents a basket and a list of buttons that represents available items; when you click on a button in the items it adds a button with the same name to the basket. It's very simple and has absolutely no GUI at all and also needs to be changed to show multiple items in the basket as one item with a quantity going up but it's a start.

I am fairly used to unpacking (or destructuring) in Javascript now as that seems to be very much the normal way when working with React, unpacking the event object to get the target property within the parameter was a bit weird to begin with but I'm used to it now. 

I think I am going to reassess my aims and go for finishing the front-end of the course by October which is when I'll get busier again. That is probably realistic considering how tricky I have found even the most basic parts of React so far.

Just keep swimming...

### Starting React - 16/08/23

So I finished learning about standard asynchronous JS and if you use async/await its fairly simple. Using the promises directly leads to some relatively hard to read syntax but I think I also get that to a decent level. I should try to implement these in my website somehow but the only way of legitimately doing that is to query an API or something (eventually I will learn to do this with a database actually) which I'm not sure I have one I'm interested in. Will have to look into cool APIs I may be able to use.

I've recently started on React now. I'm starting to feel a bit swept up in everything and need to take some time to cement my knowledge that I've got now. I think I will finish the React portion and then make a site with that; I don't think that will be able to be linked into the original site but I may end up making the whole thing in React I'm not sure. 

Work has been very busy recently as my boss is off, I'm still trying to learn as quickly as possible though. I am looking forward to learning about the back-end and tying everything together eventually.

### Multiple pages - 11/08/23

Turns out its actually very simple to join webpages together on Github Pages, just link them. So I've added the naughts and crosses to the site and put a link in the header. There are some design inconsistences though so I probably need to have one CSS sheet which every page links to and then also separate ones for each page. Will sort that soon. Also would like to get this blog on there and be able to update it from the page that would be cool. I would be able to implement that at the moment but it would have to all be kept in the front end. I may do it that way first and then eventually change it to work with a proper database in the back end.

In the online course I have started to learn about asynchronous Javascript which seems quite complicated. I may have to slow down a bit for this section which is a bit frustrating but it is also quite an interesting new thing for me so that's cool.

I'm also updating my CV and using markdown for that which I quite like. Will be applying for new jobs soon.

Anyway thats all for now.

### Starting a blog - 08/08/23

I thought it would be a good idea to record my progress in words, which I haven't been doing. I have just finished the "Building Interactive Websites" section of the full stack course. I am able to alter HTML elements with Javascript but I'm still rusty with it. I need to practise parts of the course outside of it on my own website and I think naughts and crosses would be a good webpage to make in this vein. It would develop my CSS and Javascript because the symbols will need to appear in the correct places and disappear for a new game.

I will try to record my thoughts at least once a week. I am progressing through this course as fast as I can at the moment as I will also be starting Open University soon and I need to finish it by then. I also do want to be looking for web dev jobs as soon as possible and for that I would like to get my website properly running which means getting to the back-end development part of the course.

I had the idea of making a chess board where you could move the pieces and just two people could play on the same screen. I would need to build up to this and naughts and crosses feels like a good place to start. Currently I am just making the webpages locally and eventually I will join them all together in the website when I am able to do that.
