            <p>I have just started learning how to make webpages
                and I thought it would be cool to record my progress ... 
                on a webpage! Hopefully it will increase my motivation
                and will also stand as an example of what I can do myself
                for anyone who has a look &#58;&#41;
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently about to finish the "Web Development Fundamentals"
                course on Codecademy but that is only the first section of the 
                full stack engineer pathway so I still have plenty of learning to do.
                Anyway, I will probably change this "website" many times in the future
                but I would like to keep an archive to look back on.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current state of the website/webpage does not show everything I
                can do, however I would like to concentrate on learning more as
                quickly as possible. I can arrange pages using flexbox and css grid
                however I do not feel particularly familiar with either yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, that's all for now, it is currently the 26th of June 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully I might eventually be able to do something similar to this
                as a job &#58;&#41;
